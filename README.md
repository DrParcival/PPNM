-Made the reposatory public again </br>
-Added the exercises in their folders 1-math, 2-vec/eps, 3-io, 4-genlist, 5-multiproc and 6-plots </br>
-Added EVD part A and B. I couldn't figure out how to plot the one x column and multiple colums into the same plot. Even though I read that it should work by 1:2, 1:3... it wouldn't make it happen. So now they are in seperate plots. </br>
-Neutral network method isn't perfect but I couldn't find the bug </br>
-I have been trying to find why my least square method gives wrong answers but haven't been able to solve it. I've tried debugging the QRGS solve, lsfit and main method. There wasn't really point to plotting it but I've done most of the A. Hopefully that is enugh for the 6 points.
