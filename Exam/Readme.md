This is the project number 7. </br>
-------------------------------------------- </br>
I've modified my exam project from the Spline homework. </br>
I have implemented the extra part of derivative and integral but currently the integral isn't working as it starts oscillating. But I've plotted the function and derivative for two different tests. </br>
The three different plots is of (x-1)^3, sin(x) and a step function. </br>
It wasn't mentioned if the extra corresponds to the B or C but I could complete it only half.
